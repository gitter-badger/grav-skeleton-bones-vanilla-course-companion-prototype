To make a new blog post entry duplicate an existing folder and do the following:
- name the new folder (i.e. week-n)
- edit the contents of the item.md file within the folder
- if you want to temporarily hide the page from view, set the page header variable ‘published:’ to false. For example, ‘published: false’.
- if you want a custom post icon other than the default calendar, add a page header item ‘icons:’ to the name if the font-awesome icon you want. For example, ‘icon: users’.
